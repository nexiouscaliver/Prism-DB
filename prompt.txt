read the @prismagent.py  and @postgresstool.py  file being run from the backend server at @agent-server.py . As we are using a new agent for each connected database, i wanted to ask, is it necessacary for the schema, query,read,write,admin agents to do a job? I want to increase the efficieancy and optimize my code. I want more agents to do specific tasks so that they excell in it obviously for better accuracy which is my main goal. Try to seperate all the agents into different files and import them later on in the prismagent file. Rewrite all the prompts with even better system prompts. Additionally enable all the agents to access the database specific agents for performing read,write or any other operations in the postgres database.

I want to add a new feature, all the db attached have a seperate agent. The database names 'prism' is where all the summary for all other databse can be stored and then later called a 'prism' for that database. It can enable faster selection and giving context for all the databases in the system. Write a new agent if needed or plan accordingly to periodically check for all the databases(through their respective agents) and check if their prism (in the prism database) exsists and updated. And when a user queries the db, we can query the prisms available in the system for faster context of the attached database and enable accurate decision making.

Make all the required changes for this system located in the folder @prism-framework . Read the codebase and understand the current structure, tools, agents and their prompts before starting to plan. Plan multiple a good quality execution plans that will focus on increasing the accuracy of the system and balance a response time while giving stable and accurate answers. After planning, select the best plan which will be optimal for our usecase to focus on stable, correct and accurate answers while making sure the system does not hallucinate or generate its own data and not take much to respond. Lastly start editing using the guidelines provided. Do not make mistakes wile editing and confirm after editing the file by verifying and validating the file. Make sure the prompts are good quality prompts with all the details and instructions needed for each and every agent. Make sure you provide clear, conxise and detailed instructions. Feel free to modify the exsisting prompts as per your needs to create an even better version of this exsisting system.

Take your time to understand, think, plan and reason. I have provided the web tool, use if needed to search the web at any stage necessary. All the required/mentioned files and folders for the codebase has been attached and limit the scope for your reading and writing to the @prism-framework folder only.

Start your job!
