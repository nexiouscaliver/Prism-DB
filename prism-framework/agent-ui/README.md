### Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/prismdb
cd prismdb/prism-framework/agent-ui
```

2. Install dependencies:

pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Connecting to PrismDB Backend
